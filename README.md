# Sport Events

## Introduction

Welcome to the Sport Events app repository! This Android application is designed to empower users to effortlessly organize recreational sports activities using the capabilities of mobile technology. Whether you're looking for a pick-up game of basketball, soccer, or any other recreational sport, or if you want to create your own activity based on your preferences, this app has you covered.

This project is an extension of my Bachelor's thesis, where I explored ways to utilize mobile applications for the spontaneous organization of recreational sports activities.

## Features

- **Location-Based Search**: Easily discover nearby recreational sports activities using geolocation and mapping technologies. Find activities that match your interests and location.

- **Interactive Map**: Explore a dynamic map that displays nearby activities based on your current location. The map allows you to visually identify activity locations, making it easy to find and join events that interest you.

- **Custom Activity Creation**: Create your own recreational activities tailored to your preferences. Specify the type of activity, location, time, and more.
  


## How to Use

2. **Create an Account**: Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.

3. **Discover Activities**: Use the search feature to find nearby recreational activities that interest you.

4. **Create Your Own Activity**: If you can't find the perfect activity, why not create your own? Define the details, set the location, date, and time.
